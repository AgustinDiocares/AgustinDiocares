- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AgustinDiocares I also just go by Agustin

- When I am not tring to figure out why my code isn't working or why college is so hard,
  I am either working out, or learning about some obscure philosophical or psychological study. I also like to 
  learn about art and design that makes our life easier without us realizing it.
  
- Iâ€™m currently learning data structures and other stuff that I need in my computer science degree
  plan, so I can be a competant programmer. Also some personal projects that range from web-building, 
  to creating an environment in my campus that seeks to help peers with mental health.

- Iâ€™m looking to get an entry level internship so I can get real exposure and keep developing my software skills.

- If you want to get in contact with me, my personal email is diocaresagustin@gmail.com, I look foward to hearing from you.
